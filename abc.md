first of all there are two types of requests the user will send.
1. we will give a keywords and based on that we need to generate a prompt or synopsis of that story.
2. we will give prompt, genre, tags and the recent part of the story and based on that we need to generte next part of the story in 100 words.

now i have a dataset and we can take help of it. so first lets start with 1st type of record. you will give me keywords from the story prompt that i give you. and ill arrange them in a proper format. alright?
